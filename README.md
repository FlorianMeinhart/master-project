### Content of this project is the analysis of kinematic recordings of physiotherapy movements with machine learning tools.
 
This includes:
 
Different approaches for
* distinction of exercise from non-exercise
* classification of exercises
* counting of repetitions
 
Different Machine Learning Classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVC, LDA, NN, …) from Python libraries scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
 
Evaluation and comparison of different approaches (precision, recall, accuracy, computation time, …).
